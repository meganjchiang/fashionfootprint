    "## **Q5** How are popular brands rated by Good On You? *(Megan)*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Qualitative:\n",
    "#### Problem - \n",
    "- How can we learn more about the sustainability of popular brands?\n",
    "#### Hypothesis & Claim - \n",
    "- We will extract data from Good On You's website to create a dataset of sustainability ratings for brands.\n",
    "- We will use this data to compare sustainability practices of different brands and understand possible factors that go into a sustainability rating.\n",
    "#### Context, Motivation & Rationale - \n",
    "- A *brand's* sustainability practices play a major role in determining the sustainability of a specific *product*, so it's important that we have that information.\n",
    "- We can also examine Good On You's brand descriptions to identify the criteria they use to evaluate sustainability ratings.\n",
    "#### Definitions, Data, and Methods - \n",
    "- For each of the brands, use Beautiful Soup to go to its webpage and get the overall rating, subratings (Planet, People, Animals), and description/reasoning.\n",
    "#### Assumptions - \n",
    "- Good On You has done extensive research to provide accurate and comprehensive sustainability ratings for brands.\n",
    "- Good On You considers a variety of factors/criteria related to sustainability practices."

    "#### Summary & Re-contextualization\n",
    "- We were able to get sustainability ratings for 105 brands (luxury, sustainable, fast fashion, etc.).\n",

    "- Some brands have not been rated by Good On You.\n",
    "- So far, we are only relying on one source for ratings.\n",
    "#### New Problems & Next Steps\n",
    "- We plan to cross-reference these ratings with other fashion sustainability sites, such as Eco-Stylist and Sustainable Review. This will ensure a more comprehensive and balanced assessment of the brands' sustainability practices and might also give us a broader selection of brands to analyze."

    "- We will use this data to compare sustainability practices of different brands and understand possible factors that go into a sustainability rating.\n",
    "#### Context, Motivation & Rationale - \n",
    "- We want our Chrome extension to provide more sustainable alternatives to users, so we need a set of possible sustainable brands to recommend.\n",
    "- We also aim to analyze the reasoning behind these ratings to understand the factors that Good On You took into consideration.\n",
    "#### Definitions, Data, and Methods - \n",
    "- For each of the categories listed in the directory, use Selenium to parse through their 100 recommended brands and extract the overall rating, subratings (Planet, People, Animals), and description/reasoning.\n",
    "#### Assumptions - \n",
    "- Good On You's description of each sustainable brand is informative enough that we are able to understand *why* they are considered sustainable."

    "- How can we find all of the sustainable brands that have been recommended by Good On You?\n",
    "   - We can use Selenium to find 100 sustainable brands for each clothing category.\n",
    "#### Summary & Re-contextualization\n",
    "- We were able to get sustainability ratings for 456 brands from 9 clothing categories.\n",
    "#### Uncertainty, Limitations & Caveats\n",
    "- While Good On You provides valuable sustainability ratings for a wide range of brands, it is important to note that their database may not encompass all sustainable brands in the market. Some brands, especially smaller or newer ones that may not have been evaluated by Good On You yet, could be missing from their ratings.\n",
    "#### Next Steps\n",
    "- Our Chrome extension will have a feature to recommend more sustainable alternatives from these brands."
