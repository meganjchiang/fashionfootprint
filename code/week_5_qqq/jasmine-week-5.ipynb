    "## **Q#** How can I calculate a score based on the materials? *(Jasmine)*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Qualitative:\n",
    "#### Problem -\n",
    "- We have extracted the materials from 30 brands, how do we automatically calculate a score for the materials?\n",
    "- Is there a tool that exists that can calculate a score for materials?\n",
    "#### Hypothesis & Assumptions -\n",
    "- I am assuming that there are existing tools that can help calculate a sustainability score for materials.\n",
    "#### Context, Motivation & Rationale -\n",
    "- We want to use the materials used to make clothing and products pulled from webscraped brands to make a material score that will go into our overall sustainability score.\n",
    "- By using an existing tool we do not need to dive deeper into the research that goes into calculating a material score and can focus on data collection and data science processes, as well as, building our tool.\n",
    "#### Definitions, Data, and Methods -\n",
    "- [Material Score Calculator](https://www.selflessclothes.com/blog/sustainability-calculator/) - We were able to find this material score calculator that can be used to input materials and their percentages for a score based on the Higg Materials Sustainability Index (Higg MSI).\n",
    "- [Higg Materials Sustainability Index (Higg MSI)](https://howtohigg.org/higg-msi/an-introduction-to-msi/) - \"material assessment tool that calculates the environmental impacts of materials used in consumer goods industries.\"\n",
    "- Higg MSI measures environmental impact in 5 areas:\n",
    "    - Global warming\n",
    "    - Nutrient pollution in water (eutrophication)\n",
    "    - Water scarcity\n",
    "    - Abiotic resource depletion, use of fossil fuels\n",
    "    - Chemistry\n",
    "- Method:\n",
    "    - Using string concatenation and Selenium webscraping to pull the score from the score calculator website.\n",
    "#### Biases & Assumptions\n",
    "- We are assuming that the Selfless Clothes' material score calculator is an accurate and trust worthy resource.\n",
    "- There is a possibility of bias coming from the Selfless Clothes' material score calculator & Higg MSI where they have their own biases and limitations. \n",
    "- There is a possibility of selection bias with the brands that we decided to focus on."
