    "## **Q2** How can comprehensive brand ratings be collected from Sustainable Review? *(Sabrina)*\n",
    "### Qualitative:\n",
    "#### Problem -\n",
    "- Prior web scraping methods for collecting brand ratings from Sustainable Review took ~30 minutes\n",
    "- Despite attempting up to 3 times, the code always failed to access a few links\n",
    "- Only collecting the headers in brand descriptions did not provide enough information about how the brand rating was determined\n",
    "- How can the web scraping process be broken down to speed up the collection process and ensure all links are accessed?\n",
    "#### Hypothesis & Claim -\n",
    "- We can break down the web scraping process by writing out a function which specifically scrapes brand review pages by Sustainable Review \n",
    "- Increasing the number of attempts will increase the chances that all links are accessed.\n",
    "#### Context, Motivation & Rationale -\n",
    "- We are motivated to shorten the length of time it takes to scrape the website is important because the code must be run every time the website updates.\n",
    "- Ensuring that the resulting dataset is comprehensive will allow us to compare the ratings of more brands across organizations\n",
    "- Webscraping with the Python library BeautifulSoup because it is popular and well documented\n",
    "- Sustainable Review documents all of the research which ultimately determines the overall sustainability score in their brand description\n",
    "#### Definitions, Data, and Methods -\n",
    "- Sustainable Review publishes sustinability content weekly\n",
    "- Data will be collected from the Sustainability Review website\n",
    "- The Python library requests which allows us to define the number of attempts\n",
    "- Webscraping with the Python library BeautifulSoup to visit the webpage for each brand review and get the overall rating and brand description\n",
    "#### Biases & Assumptions -\n",
    "- All brand review pages include the brand name, rating, and description\n",
    "- All brand review pages are structured the same\n",
    "- Breaking down the web scraping process will speed it up"

    "### Qualitative (pt. 2):\n",
    "#### Answer/Update to Question/Claim\n",
    "- We successfully broke down the web scraping process by writing out a function which specifically scrapes brand review pages by Sustainable Review and takes in a list of links.\n",
    "- As no active links were missed, increasing the number of attempts may have improved the chances that all links are accessed, but writing out a function made a greater difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary & Re-contextualization\n",
    "- The average runtime for scraping the Sustainable Review website dropped from ~30 minutes to ~6 minutes, which is a major improvement.\n",
    "- Collecting the full brand description rather than just the headings in the brand description yielded a lot more information about how brands were rated\n",
    "- The Sustainable Review dataset is now at the same quality as the Eco-Stylist and Good on You datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Uncertainty, Limitations & Caveats\n",
    "- Some links may still fail to be accessed even with more tries\n",
    "- The brand description is much longer than just the headers, meaning the text includes more irrelevant words that will not help predict the brand rating\n",
    "\n",
    "#### New Problems & Next Steps\n",
    "- Since Megan worked on extracting relevant words from brand descriptions, adding the extracted keywords into this dataset and using them to calculate our own sustainability score would be the next step\n",
    "- The quality of the dataset has also been improved, so it can be combined with the eco-stylist dataset for easier comparisons across ratings\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Story & Domain Knowledge\n",
    "- Scraping the brand ratings from Sustainable Review again allowed us to improve upon prior code, making it more efficient, less redundant, and more reliable\n",
    "- We relied on domain knowledge about Python to determine that scraping the entire brand description would be most helpful for calculating a sustainability score"

    "## **Q3** How can we compare ratings from organizatins like Good for You, Eco-Stylist, and Sustainable Review?\n",
    "### Qualitative:\n",
    "#### Problem -\n",
    "- To compare brand ratings across organizations, we must read in 4 separate datasets and repeatedly combine them\n",
    "- Each organization rated their brands on different scales and criteria, meaning some brands are ranked by category rather than a rating out of 5\n",
    "- How can we combine all four datasets in an understandable way and compare different types of brand ratings?\n",
    "#### Hypothesis & Claim -\n",
    "- We will join all four datasets on the name of the brand and standardize the overall brand rating from each organization to calculate the average rating for a brand\n",
    "- Converting qualitative rankings to quantiative ratings will make brand ratings easier to compare because quantiative ratings are easier to scale\n",
    "#### Context, Motivation & Rationale -\n",
    "- We are motivated to combine the datasets in a clear and understandable way so that we only have to read in 1 dataset in the future when conducting data analysis and calculating sustainability scores\n",
    "- Combining the datasets beforehand also removes the possibility that they will be combined incorrectly later\n",
    "- Synthesizing the overall brand ratings through an average makes sense since they all have well documented methodologies for determining brand ratings\n",
    "- Data manipulation in the Python library Pandas because it is popular and well documented\n",
    "#### Definitions, Data, and Methods -\n",
    "- Sustainability Review publishes sustainability content weekly\n",
    "- Eco-Stylist is a guide to ethical and eco-friendly fashion\n",
    "- Good on You is home to thousands of brand ratings, articles, and sustainable fashion expertise\n",
    "- Data will be read in from the existing data folder in our GitHub repository \n",
    "- Datasets will be joined and categorical ratings will be converted using the industry standard Python library Pandas for data analysis and manipulation  \n",
    "#### Biases & Assumptions -\n",
    "- All brand rankings hold the same weight (given that they are being averaged)\n",
    "- All brand names are unique and can be used as the key to join on"

    "#### Answer/Update to Question/Claim\n",
    "- We successfully joined all four datasets on the name of the brand by normalizing the brand names and standardized the overall brand rating from each organization to calculate the average rating for a brand\n",
    "- Converting qualitative rankings to quantiative ratings did make brand ratings easier to compare because quantiative ratings are easier to scale and can be plugged into math formulas\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary & Re-contextualization\n",
    "- Over 450+ brands were rated by multiple organizations, meaning their brand ratings could be averaged \n",
    "- Joining the datasets and writing out a csv will be helpful for calculating our own sustainability score and conducting data analysis because correctly joining the datasets was a complex process which involved manually normalizing brand names, resulting in a high potential for error\n",
    "- Brand names had to be normalized to use as keys for joining because brand names often contain special characters\n",
    "- Scaling the rankings for Eco-Stylist from 1-3 to 1-5 caused ratings to go from integers to floats, but this was not an issue because most of the averages are also floats\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Uncertainty, Limitations & Caveats\n",
    "- The Pandas function .to_csv() sometimes creates an unnamed column based on the index, which created some issues when initally reading in csv data from our github repository \n",
    "- Not all brand names were unique, as some were only differentiated by special characters or capitalization, so some normalized brand names had to be manually edited\n",
    "- The code for combining columns and checking for duplicate normalized brand names is somewhat redundant\n",
    "\n",
    "#### New Problems & Next Steps\n",
    "- Moving forward, we hope to reduce the redundancy in the code for joining datasets to improve efficiency\n",
    "- We also hope to remove the manual element of identifying and editing duplicate normalized brand names so that the code is more reliable and long lasting\n",
    "- Additional columns may also be added containing the keywords extracted from the brand descriptions for calculating our own sustainability score\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Story & Domain Knowledge\n",
    "- The assumption that brand names would be unique was proven false, so our approach to combining the datasets had to adjust accordingly\n",
    "- This joined dataset offers a far more comprehensive idea of how fashion brands are rated for sustainability and has to potential to contribute to general domain knowledge about the topic"
