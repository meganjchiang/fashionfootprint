    "- We were able to get sustainability ratings for 105 brands (luxury, sustainable, fast fashion, etc.).\n",

    "- Some brands have not been rated by Good On You.\n",
    "- So far, we are only relying on one source for ratings.\n",
    "#### New Problems & Next Steps\n",
    "- We plan to cross-reference these ratings with other fashion sustainability sites, such as Eco-Stylist and Sustainable Review. This will ensure a more comprehensive and balanced assessment of the brands' sustainability practices and might also give us a broader selection of brands to analyze."

    "- We will use this data to compare sustainability practices of different brands and understand possible factors that go into a sustainability rating.\n",
    "#### Context, Motivation & Rationale - \n",
    "- We want our Chrome extension to provide more sustainable alternatives to users, so we need a set of possible sustainable brands to recommend.\n",
    "- We also aim to analyze the reasoning behind these ratings to understand the factors that Good On You took into consideration.\n",
    "#### Definitions, Data, and Methods - \n",
    "- For each of the categories listed in the directory, use Selenium to parse through their 100 recommended brands and extract the overall rating, subratings (Planet, People, Animals), and description/reasoning.\n",
    "#### Assumptions - \n",
    "- Good On You's description of each sustainable brand is informative enough that we are able to understand *why* they are considered sustainable."

    "- How can we find all of the sustainable brands that have been recommended by Good On You?\n",
    "   - We can use Selenium to find 100 sustainable brands for each clothing category.\n",
    "#### Summary & Re-contextualization\n",
    "- We were able to get sustainability ratings for 456 brands from 9 clothing categories.\n",
    "#### Uncertainty, Limitations & Caveats\n",
    "- While Good On You provides valuable sustainability ratings for a wide range of brands, it is important to note that their database may not encompass all sustainable brands in the market. Some brands, especially smaller or newer ones that may not have been evaluated by Good On You yet, could be missing from their ratings.\n",
    "#### Next Steps\n",
    "- Our Chrome extension will have a feature to recommend more sustainable alternatives from these brands."

    "## **Q6** How are sustainable brands rated on Eco-Stylist? *(Sabrina)*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Qualitative:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem - \n",
    "- Our team can collect information about brands directly from their websites, but the information required to make an accurate assessment of brand sustainability is often unavailable\n",
    "- What criteria do established organizations like Eco-Stylist use to rate sustainability?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypothesis & Claim - \n",
    "- We will extract data from Eco-Stylist's website to create a dataset of sustainabiltiy ratings for brands\n",
    "- Examining the criteria used Eco-Stylist for evaluating brands will help us develop our own formula for rating sustainability\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Context, Motivation & Rationale - \n",
    "- Established organizations focused on sustainability in fashion like Eco-Stylist have already dedicated time and resources to collect and analyze the relevant data for rating brands\n",
    "- Eco-stylist also offers transparency about what criteria they consider for their overall sustainability score\n",
    "- We are motivated to extract data from Eco-Stylist to have sustainability ratings to compare our own against\n",
    "- Webscraping with the Python library BeautifulSoup because it is popular and well documented\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definitions, Data, and Methods -\n",
    "- Eco-Stylist is a guide to ethical and eco-friendly fashion\n",
    "- Data will be collected from the Eco-Stylist website\n",
    "- Webscraping with the Python library BeautifulSoup to visit the webpage for each brand and get the overall rating and subratings (Transparency, Fair Labor, Sustainably Made)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Biases & Assumptions -\n",
    "- The research which informs the subratings is reliable and fact checked\n",
    "- All brands which Eco-Stylist has collected sustainability data on are publicly available"

    "\n",
    "#### Answer/Update to Question/Claim\n",
    "- Eco-Stylist assesses brand sustainability based on the criteria transparency, fair labor, and sustainably made. Then, it assigns an overall rating.\n",
    "- We successfully extracted data from Eco-Stylist's website to create a dataset of sustainability ratings for brands\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary & Re-contextualization\n",
    "- Breaking down the overall sustainability rating into distinct subratings helps provide context for why a brand recieved a certain score and allows the overall ratings to be easily compared\n",
    "- We may create a similiar subrating to \"Sustainably Made\" for calculating our own sustainability ratings by evaluating what materials a product is made out of\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Uncertainty, Limitations & Caveats\n",
    "- A highly limited number of brands were rated by Eco-Stylist\n",
    "- Eco-Stylist only evaluates sustainable brands (omitting most popular fast fashion brands)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### New Problems & Next Steps\n",
    "- We will scrape data from more organizations which review fashion brands to increase the number of ratings we can compare ours against\n",
    "- How can we compare sustainability ratings across different organizations?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Story & Domain Knowledge\n",
    "- Scraping data from the Eco-Stylist website was relatively simple because the links to each brand review had a uniform format \n",
    "- The criteria used by Eco-Stylist to determined the overall sustainability score resembles the citeria used by Good for You"

    "## **Q7** How are sustainable brands rated on Sustainable Review? *(Sabrina)*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Qualitative:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem - \n",
    "- Eco-Stylist only reviewed sustainable brands, and the information required to make an accurate assessment of brand sustainability is often unavailable on brand websites\n",
    "- What criteria do established organizations which have reviewed a greater number of brands like Sustainable Review use to rate sustainability?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypothesis & Claim - \n",
    "- We will extract data from Sustainable Review's website to create a dataset of sustainabiltiy ratings for brands\n",
    "- Summarizing the research and factors which determine the overall sustainability rating of a brand could provide insight into how we should rate brands \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Context, Motivation & Rationale - \n",
    "- Sustainable Review had a more comprehensive database of brands they have rated compared to Eco-Stylist\n",
    "- Sustainable Review documents all of the research which ultimately determines the overall sustainability score\n",
    "- We are motivated to investigate whether relevant factors for rating sustainability can be extracted from the description of each brand on Sustainable Review\n",
    "- Webscraping with the Python library BeautifulSoup because it is popular and well documented\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definitions, Data, and Methods -\n",
    "- Sustainability Review publishes sustainability content weekly\n",
    "- Data will be collected from the Sustainability Review website\n",
    "- Webscraping with the Python library BeautifulSoup to visit the webpage for each brand and get the overall rating and factors (headlines from within the description)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Biases & Assumptions -\n",
    "- The research which informs the overall ratings is up to date\n",
    "- All brands which Sustainable Review has collected sustainability data on are publicly available"

    "- Sustainability Review determines overall brand sustainability by synthesizing research on the brand's sustainability efforts. It rates brands on a scale of 1-5.\n",
    "- We successfully extracted data from Sustainability Reviews's website to create a dataset of sustainability ratings for brands\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary & Re-contextualization\n",
    "- Synthesizing the main factors which went into the sustainability score by isolating the headlines in the brand description helped explain the score\n",
    "- The factors we consider for our own sustainability score will be limited to the information available about a product online, but this often includes the materials used to create it\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Uncertainty, Limitations & Caveats\n",
    "- The quality and presence of headlines in the brand description varied greatly\n",
    "- The large number of brands evaluated by Sustainability Review caused web scraping to take a long time and resulted in failure to access a couple links to brand reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "#### New Problems & Next Steps\n",
    "- Can we ensure that all links to brand reviews can be accessed by breaking down the scraping process?\n",
    "- Are qualitative or quantitative ratings more effective for communicating the sustainability score of a fashion brand?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Story & Domain Knowledge\n",
    "- Scraping data from Sustainability Review was more complex than scraping data from Eco-Stylist because the brands the organization had rated were not all available on one page\n",
    "- The factors which went into the sustainability score line up with general domain knowledge about what makes a brand sustainable"
