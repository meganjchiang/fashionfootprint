    "- We should be able to search through fashion data by matching titles to a set of fashion-related keywords\n",
    "- Then extract links from the video descriptions  \n",
    "#### Context, Motivation & Rationale - \n",
    "- We want the Chrome Extension to work on YouTube, so seeing if we can access links and scrape them to provide feedback is an important first step.  \n",
    "- Having a dataset of existing YouTube videos may also help us test our tool on a smaller scale while in the development stages\n",
    "#### Rationale, Assumptions, Biases - \n",
    "- Assuming all YouTube data gathered is accurate and reliable\n",
    "- My rationale in selecting my keywords is my own knowledge of how fashion-related YouTube videos are titled\n",
    "- I may be biased towards certain keywords/titles due to my watching certain types of fashion content\n",

    "- How can we better organize data?\n",
    "   - We are able to find videos and search based on specific brands\n",
    "   - We can then filter further by searching for fashion-related keywords in the title\n",
    "- How can we get the max amount of data given the quota and results limit?\n",
    "   - Filtering by brands gets us more data since we can extract up to 50 fashion-related videos from a specific brand rather than 50 fashion-related videos overall\n",
